### Question 2.

Forecasting Shampoo Sales: The file ShampooSales.xls contains data on the monthly sales of a certain shampoo over a three-year period.
If the goal is forecasting sales in future months, which of the following steps should be taken?
(choose one or more below).

-   [ ] Partition the data into training and validation periods.
-   [ ] Examine time plots of the series and of model forecasts only for the training period.
-   [ ] Look at MAPE and RMSE values for the training period.
-   [ ] Look at MAPE and RMSE values for the validation period.
-   [ ] Compute na√Øve forecasts. Page 1 of 2


#### Question CH3-Q2 Answer:

### Question 3.

Performance on Training and Validation Data: Two different models were fit to the same time series.
The first 100 time periods were used for the training period and the last 12 periods were treated as a validation period.
Assume that both models make sense practically and fit the data reasonably well.
Below are the RMSE values for each of the models:

| Model   | Training Period | Validation Period |
|:--------|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| Model A |       543       |        690        |
| Model B |       669       |        675        |

a)  Which model appears more useful for retrospectively describing the different components of this time series?
    Why?

b)  Which model appears to be more useful for forecasting purposes?
    Why?
